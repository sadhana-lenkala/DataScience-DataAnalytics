# Prediction of Diabetes 
Following project presents a prediction model which predicts if the person has diabetes or not using the following data from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

[Pima Indian Diabetes dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Pima+Indians+Diabetes "Pima Indian Diabetes dataset")

We will use first use basic modeling techniques and then ensemble all the better predicting models together  to acheive the above stated goal and then tune our model for better prediction.

# DataSet Summary

1. Number of times pregnant 
2. Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test 
3. Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg) 
4. Triceps skin fold thickness (mm) 
5. 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml) 
6. Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2) 
7. Diabetes pedigree function 
8. Age (years) 
9. Class variable (0 or 1)
