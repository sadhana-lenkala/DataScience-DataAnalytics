# Gun Death Analysis in US

The dataset is hosted on [FiveThirtyEight](http://fivethirtyeight.com/), and can be found [here](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/guns-data/blob/master/full_data.csv) too.  It contains information on gun deaths in the US from 2012 to 2014. Each row in the dataset represents a single fatality. The columns contain demographic and other information about the victim. Also, this data will be compared with the census data for the corresponding period to derive insight on how the trends differ based on different criterias e.g. race, gender etc.
