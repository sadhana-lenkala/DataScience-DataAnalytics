# Star Wars Series Popularity Analysis
I am huge Star Wars fan and wonder often which one is the most popular one. There are a lot of surveys available over the internet which can help us find answer of the above question. One such dataset is available at SurveyMonkey which is used for following analysis.

The details of the Survey can be found [here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americas-favorite-star-wars-movies-and-least-favorite-characters/ "Star Wars Survey") and collected data can be found [here](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/star-wars-survey "Star Wars Survey Git Hub Repo").
